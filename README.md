# Nashville Discipline

Allegations of retalitation abound at the Nashville Police.

*Reporter: Will Craft (<wcraft@apmreports.org>)*

## Project goal
Officers at the MNPD have alleged that there are patterns of retaliation against people who speak up about conditions at the department. APM Reports and WPLN wanted to test whether people who file grievances and OPA complaints against fellow officers are more likely to be disciplined and if so, if there are clear patterns between being disciplined and when they filed their complaints.

      - IA2020-00031 (A): Antigona Gashi against Robert Morris. This is my source who says she was harassed for being European. OPA simultaneously opened investigation IA2020-00031 (B) for self-control and false or frivolous accusations, but it was ultimately unfounded.
